Project Deliverables
====================

This section is dedicated to reporting the final state of the commitments we made in our original project proposal, as well as discussing how our team is handing the project off to the sponsor.

Deliverables
------------

The following list shows the deliverables of our project and their current status.

1. A GPU based implementation of the probabalistic tracking algorithm that produces identical or near-identical results as the existing CPU based implementation. Completed to specification. Speed increase validated.

**Status**: Completed to specification.

2. Feature port of the features included in the Ptx2 suite: Masking and waypoint conditions, euler streamlining.          

**Status**: TODO Steve 

3. Update the Graphical User Interface to be able to interact with Oclptx.

**Status**: Cut from the project scope. The sponsor will handle this if needed.

Ultimately, we will hand over our source code to our sponsor by both a direct port into their machine, as well as a link to a branch in our github from which the sponsor can clone the code. 


Ongoing Project Work
--------------------

The FMRIB team which works on the primary branch of FSL has been interested in our work, although they appear to want more development before they agree to pull it in their their main distribution. Steve Novakov has expressed interest in possibly supporting additional changes if it could bring our module into the medical community. Such support would be done from May 2014 to August 2014 on a part-time basis. As FMRIB is not the sponsor, Steve's commitment would not be in direct correlation with the sponsor.
