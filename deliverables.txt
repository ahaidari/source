Project Deliverables
====================

This section is dedicated to reporting the final state of the commitments we made in our original project proposal, as well as discussing how our team is handing the project off to the sponsor.

Deliverables
------------

Project deliverables specified by the sponsor, and their state of completion:

1.  A GPU based implementation of the probabilistic tracking algorithm that produces identical or near-identical results as the existing CPU based implementation, with the following points of consideration:

    #. Fully parallel, with support for an arbitrary number of particles.
    #. Functions with the typical CFRI bedpostx parameter dimensions of 256x271x102, and up to the maximum possible allocation size for this data.
    #. Outputs a total global connectivity map in a properly formatted ascii file, for which the sponsor can use the fslascii2img library to convert to the desired niftii format.

**Status**: Completed to specification. However, there is inconsistent operation with very large bedpostx data files on the designated CFRI workstation, sometimes returning garbage results. The issue is not present on our local machines. This is being debugged.

2.  Feature port of additional features included in the *probtrackx* suite:

    #. Termination/Exclusion mask support.
    #. Waypoint Mask support.
    #. Improved Euler interpolation.

**Status**: Completed to specification.

3. Update the Graphical User Interface (GUI) to be able to interact with *oclptx*.

**Status**: Cut from the project scope. The sponsor will implement the GUI.

Ultimately, we will hand over our source code to our sponsor by both a direct port into their machine, as well as a link to a branch in our github repositories.


Ongoing Project Work
--------------------
TODO Jeff: Modify this as needed.
TODO Steve: Modify this as needed.
The FMRIB team which works on the primary branch of FSL has been interested in our work, although they appear to want more development before they agree to pull it in their their main distribution. Steve Novakov has expressed interest in possibly supporting additional changes if it could bring our module into the medical community. Such support would be done from May 2014 to August 2014 on a part-time basis. As FMRIB is not the sponsor, Steve's commitment would not be in direct correlation with the sponsor.
