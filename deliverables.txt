Project Deliverables
====================

This section is dedicated to reporting the final state of the commitments we made in our original project proposal, as well as discussing how our team is handing the project off to the sponsor.

Deliverables
------------

Project deliverables specified by the sponsor, and their state of completion w.r.t. functioning on some level:

1.  A GPU based implementation of the probabalistic tracking algorithm that produces identical or near-identical results as the existing CPU based implementation with the following points of consideration:

    #. Fully parallel, with support for an arbitrary number of particles.
    #. Functions with the typical CFRI BedpostX parameter dimensions of 256x271x102 (not 102, something else), and up to the maximum possible allocation size for this data.
    #. Outputs total global pdf in properly formatted ascii file, for which the sponsor can use the fslascii2img library to convert to niftii.

**Status**: Completed to specification. However, there is inconsistent operation with very large BedpostX data files on the designated CFRI workstation, sometimes returning garbage results. This is being debugged, and the sponsor will not sign off on the project until this resolved.

2.  Feature port of additional features included in the Ptx2 suite:

    #. Termination/Exclusion mask support.
    #. Waypoint Mask support.
    #. Improved Euler (RK2) interpolation.

**Status**: Completed to specification.

3. Update the Graphical User Interface to be able to interact with Oclptx.

**Status**: Cut from the project scope. The sponsor will handle this.

Ultimately, we will hand over our source code to our sponsor by both a direct port into their machine, as well as a link to a branch in our github from which the sponsor can clone the source code.

Currently, there are some problems with executing this software on the sponsor's workstation when working with larger bedpostx sizes. The software produces legitimate results on smaller voxel dimensions, (such as 102x102x60), but on the default CFRI voxel dimensions, (256x271x102), the output pdf file is consistently null (all zeroes).

Ongoing Project Work
--------------------

The FMRIB team which works on the primary branch of FSL has been interested in our work, although they appear to want more development before they agree to pull it in their their main distribution. Steve Novakov has expressed interest in possibly supporting additional changes if it could bring our module into the medical community. Such support would be done from May 2014 to August 2014 on a part-time basis. As FMRIB is not the sponsor, Steve's commitment would not be in direct correlation with the sponsor.
