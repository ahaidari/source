Project Deliverables
====================

This section is dedicated to reporting the final state of the commitments we made in our original project proposal, as well as discussing how our team is handing the project off to the sponsor.

Deliverables
------------

The complete project can be found at its home on GitHub:  https://github.com/jefftaylor42/oclptx

The following are the Project deliverables specified by the sponsor, and their state of completion:

1.  A GPU based implementation of the probabilistic tracking algorithm that produces identical or near-identical results as the existing CPU based implementation, with the following points of consideration:

    #. Fully parallel, with support for an arbitrary number of particles.
    #. Functions with the typical CFRI bedpostx parameter dimensions of 256x271x102, and up to the maximum possible allocation size for this data.
    #. Outputs a total global connectivity map in a properly formatted ascii file, for which the sponsor can use the fslascii2img library to convert to the desired niftii format.

  **Status**: Completed to specification. However, there is inconsistent operation with very large bedpostx data files on the designated CFRI workstation, sometimes returning garbage results. The issue is not present on our local machines. This is being debugged.

2.  Feature port of additional features included in the *probtrackx* suite:

    #. Termination/Exclusion mask support.
    #. Waypoint Mask support.
    #. Improved Euler interpolation.

  **Status**: Completed to specification.

3. Update the Graphical User Interface (GUI) to be able to interact with *oclptx*.

  **Status**: Cut from the project scope. The sponsor will implement the GUI.

Ultimately, we will hand over our source code to our sponsor by installing it directly onto their machine.


Ongoing Project Work
--------------------
We've been in contact with the main FSL team.  Our work has several dependencies within FSL. The FSL team is not familiar with our codebase, and due to the intricate nature of GPU software, they don't want to support our work. 

We would like to see this software being used for work outside of CFRI.  As a result, we are willing to provide a limited amount of support to the FSL team.  Since this is voluntary, we will not commit to any particular amount of time.  If the feature size is beyond what we are willing to see through, we can point the requester towards the relevant code sections.
